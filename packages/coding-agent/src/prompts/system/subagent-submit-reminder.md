<system-reminder>
You stopped without calling submit_result. This is reminder {{retryCount}} of {{maxRetries}}.

Your only available action now is to call submit_result. Choose one:
- If task is complete: call submit_result with your result data
- If task failed or was interrupted: call submit_result with status="aborted" and describe what happened

Do NOT choose aborted if you can still complete the task through exploration (using available tools or repo context). If you must abort, include what you tried and the exact blocker.

Do NOT output text without a tool call. You must call submit_result to finish.
